Summary:
In 12 hours, we built a forum for donors and our beneficiaries to communicate upon donation.
Our forum platforms include a HTML website and an Android application.
We also have an Excel-reading application which will generate a pictorial chart for visual purposes.

Team Night Autumn:
Jiayee (me) - website to read donor messages and send replies
Abby - CRM to upload Excel file and generate analytics chart from Excel file and donor messages
Yong Kiat and Jun Kwang - Android app to allow donors to donate and send messages of hope
Zion - implement REST API to read messages, add messages and add replies
